          Hi! I'm Adit Chawdhary currently working as a Software Engineer at Intuit. I have created this web app to discuss algorithms of interest, 
          the implementations of these algorithms can be found on Github. The Algorithms Workshop is available on YouTube platform as well. 
          On the YouTube channel I've explained multiple stages of these algorithms.

          I graduated from the University of Cincinnati with a Master's in Computer Science in May 2021. There is got a chance to pursue multiple interests
          ranging from Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Visualization, Backend Development, Microservice Architecture, Frontend Web Development and Big Data Analysis with Distributed Systems.
          I have covered some topics from each of these in the Algorithms Workshop. I have hands-on experience in these feilds with great exposure in some and novice in others. 
          I am willing to explore any of these fields.
